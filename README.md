Completed: Dec 2016

An indvidual large-scale class assignment that spanned over 4 months. Used C, python, MySQL, JavaScript, PHP, HTML and CSS to upload files onto a server via a web page I created. The webpage used called C and python programs which would work together to format text based on a info file provided by the user. 

A1: Created a linked list of strings and functions to process the strings from a file. Functions were created to remove white space and adding HTML tags where specified. These strings can be stored and retrieved from binary files. 

A2: Wrote a python program which called the C library functions I wrote in A1. This python program further changed font characteristics. 

A3: Built a website with a graphical interface which allowed users to view files, convert text to html files using the C program from assignment 2, and load files onto the class webserver. 

A4: Added MySQL database access to store and retrieve html pages using the webpage created in A3 and conversion program from previous assignments. Wrote a utility program which allows users to view and manage the database.
